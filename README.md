## Professional Projects  

**1. Meal Generator:**  
Led the initiative for the "Meal Generator" product at UpMeals, overseeing its development from inception to execution. Orchestrated the creation of robust data pipelines to procure contextual information, implementing advanced prompt engineering strategies to enhance interactions with the GPT-4 LLM through the OpenAI API. Implemented a rigorous validation framework, meticulously aligning outputs with company inventory to ensure the delivery of innovative culinary solutions that catered precisely to user preferences. This AI solution significantly enhanced the organization's product development capabilities.

**2. Made 'Smart Vending Machines' smarter:**  
Spearheaded a strategic initiative focused on enhancing operational efficiency of UpMeals Smart Vending Machines through advanced forecasting and machine learning techniques. Implemented ETL pipelines, conducted data analysis and feature engineering to develop robust ML models for Demand Forecasting and Sales Classification. This initiative successfully reduced product wastage, increased profitability, and improved Sell Through Rate by approximately 40%.

**3. Wildlife Detection in Databricks:**  
Worked on a pioneering project at Agnico Eagle Mines on behalf of Dogico, leveraging Azure Databricks to develop a scalable solution for wildlife image analysis. Designed and implemented a distributed machine learning pipeline using PySpark, SQL and pandas UDFs, integrating a custom-trained YoloV5 model for efficient inference across large image repositories. This initiative significantly reduced time and costs associated with manual image evaluation, achieving approximately 75% decrease in processing time and identifying five times more wildlife images compared to manual methods.

## Outside Work

I enjoy hiking, traveling, workout, and martial arts.
