## Professional & Freelance Projects

#### **NLP / LLM**

**1. Create new products using Generative AI:** Implemented an innovative approach in crafting new products (organic healthy meals) for UpMeals by using Generative AI. Engineered robust data pipelines for ETL & employed meticulous Prompt Engineering strategies for optimal model interaction. Connected to the GPT-4 large language model through the OpenAI API and ensured the quality of generated content through validation against company inventory.

#### **Vision**

**2. Risk Analysis:** Solved the risk of train derailment caused by rocks on mine rails using advanced predictive modelling, resulting in over 95% accuracy in alerting mine operators & optimizing mining operations significantly.  

**3. Anomaly Detection:** Developed an AutoEncoder based Anomaly Detection system to identify structural issues in mine trains, resulting in reduced derailment risk, optimized maintenance schedules & significant cost savings.  

**4. Wildlife Detection in Databricks:** Designed a process in Azure Databricks to analyze & identify wildlife images across large image repositories using PySpark, TensorFlow & Yolo models, thereby reducing time & cost associated with manual image evaluation.  

**5. Live video analysis (POC):** Created a real time live video analysis prototype in Databricks, employing Python & OpenCV for video capture, with Databricks Streaming, Object Detection, & Delta Tables for data processing, facilitating future advancements in Databricks-based video analysis within the organization.  

## Presentations

1. Presented the "Wildlife Detection in Databricks" project to the Databricks Montreal User Group.
